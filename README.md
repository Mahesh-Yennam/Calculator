## About

I developed this calculator by referring to a standard calculator and tried to replicate its behavior as closely as possible. While building it, I explored various scenarios to understand why certain logic was required and implemented features accordingly.

I also took help from search engines whenever I felt stuck, especially while fixing edge cases. Developing this calculator was a very interesting experience, as it presented challenges at every step. I approached the problems one step at a time and focused on identifying and fixing both existing and potential issues.

I would really appreciate it if you try out the calculator. If you find any bugs or improvements, I’d be glad to learn about them and work on making this calculator even better.
